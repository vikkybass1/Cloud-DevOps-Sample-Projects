    This template deploys web servers using cloud formation, It deploys a VPC, with 4 servers, a pair each in the private subnets spread 
    across two Availabilty Zones. It deploys an Internet Gateway, with a default 
    route on the public subnets. It deploys a pair of NAT Gateways (one in each AZ), 
    and default routes for them in the private subnets.

Parameters:
  # Paramenters are entirely optional.
  # but using them will make your cloudformation templates more reusable
  # use them for things that may change over time, such as instance type,
  # VPCs and so on.

Resources:
  # A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to a AWS account.
  # It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch
  # a AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into a VPC. When you create a VPC,
  # you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the form of a
  # Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.
  # This is the primary CIDR block for your VPC

# Sample UserData
# When creating your Launch Configuration, you may need a UserData script
# here's one that you can use for Ubuntu Linux that will:
# Install Apache Web Server, Start it, and create an index.html that will be displayed
# when you visit the IP address of this server with your web browser
#Here it is:
#
#          #!/bin/bash
#          apt-get update -y
#          apt-get install apache2 -y
#          systemctl start apache2.service
#          cd /var/www/html
#          echo "Udacity Demo Web Server Up and Running!" > index.html
